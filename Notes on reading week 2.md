## **Clay Shirky's Writings About the Internet**  

Yes finally someone who agrees that a linear approach of categorisation isn't the way for web information  

 1. Ontology: Philosophical
	study of entities and their relations
 2. Ontology: AI
	Explicit specification of a conceptualization
	
Both are concerned with the classification and/or categorization of entities

the idea that everything has a logical place within a system even before it exists is impossible because
that would mean that you would have a perfect system that takes in account all known and **unknown**	information

Since the beginning of the internet people have tried to apply the linear structures of classic categorization
and classification in order to organize the web but what is becoming more and more obvious is that the web isn't
linear at all. The web is much more fluid and dynamic. --> _will the web a semi visual representation of the brain?_

--> categories are depended on language as language changes so do the categories: words come and go

>People have been freaking out about the virtualy of data for decades, and you'd think we'd have internalized
the obvious truth: there is no shelf. In the digital world, there is no physical constraint that's forcing this kind
of organization on us any longer.

>Yahoo is saying "We understand better than you how the world is organized, because we are trained
professionals. So if you mistakenly think that Books and Literature are entertainment, we'll put a little flag up
so we can set you right, but to see those links, you have to 'go' to where they 'are'." (My fingers are going to
fall off from all the air quotes.) When you go to Literature -- which is part of Humanities, not Entertainment
-- you are told, similarly, that booksellers are not 'really' there. Because they are a commercial service,
booksellers are 'really' in Business.


--> Yahoo's categorisation has become outdated due to web 2.0: As more people start talking on the web and posting
a large repository of natural language comes to live -> people are linking topics themselves by talking about it
 but that is what Shirky is probably is aiming for with tagging
 
 
 --> page 10: can the type of taggs people use predict their social status because of jargon? see page 14
 
 --> page 13: everyone tagging according to their own requirement and thereby organizing the web: 
	isn't that only on the basis that human thinking is to some point equal to everyone? and will that
	lead to a universal language where a basic set of words and meanings on which we all agree on? Webspeak
	
--> page 14: different levels of tagging: doesn't it reflect user participation on the web where there are about
	few who are very active and many who are hardly active at all
	
>You can see there's a tag "to_read". A professional cataloguer would look at this tag in horror -- "This is
context-dependent and temporary." Well, so was the category "East Germany."

--> lol funny
